Welcome to the world of Mr. Jonas Kahnwald. Mr. Kahnwald has envisioned a General-Purpose Store that revolutionizes the way people shop in his town. With the aim of providing a seamless shopping experience, he plans to develop an application that allows customers to order products online or purchase them directly from the store. This application will offer a wide range of product categories, including Grocery Items, Electronic Items, Sports Items, Cosmetics, and a Miscellaneous category for unique items.

In this scenario, we will explore the theoretical aspects and practical implementation of Mr. Kahnwald's vision. We will delve into the world of object-oriented concepts, logical class identification, relationships among classes, and the application of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to develop the system.
